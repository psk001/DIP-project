## "Streakflow for Crowd Segmentation"

Dominant crowd flow segmentation is the first step towards building an automated monitoring
system for high density crowd scenes. In computer vision, optical flow is widely used to compute
pixel wise instantaneous motion between consecutive frames, and numerous methods are reported
to efficiently compute accurate optical flow. However, optical flow does not capture long-range
temporal dependencies, since it is based on just two frames. In order to achieve an accurate
representation of flow from crowd motion, we use the streaklines to compute a new motion field
which we refer to as streak flow. To compute streak flow, streaklines are computed by temporally
integrating optical flow.
